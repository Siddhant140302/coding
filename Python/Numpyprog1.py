'''Numpy numerical python 
-> Numpy is the fundamentall pakag for scientific compation in python it contains among 
other things:
 a) a powerful N dimensional array object (Mathematical and logical)
 b) sophiscated (broadcasting) function
 c) tools for integrating c/c++ and fortran code
 d) useful linear algebra, fourier transform, and random number compablities
 
-> Numpy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional  container of generic data 
artibary data types can be defined
-> Numpy is often used with packages like scipy (scientific python) and mat-plotlib 
(plotting library)'''
import numpy as np
a= np.array([1,2,3])      #one dimensional array
b= np.array([[1,2] , [3,4]])
